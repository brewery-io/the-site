    <p >A bit of a preamle/preramble: </p>
    <p >A couple of weeks ago, after a sudden bout of inspiration, I thought "hey, why not give game dev a try?"</p>
    <p >I can tell you why not: it's hard, it's time consuming, and there's often little payoff.</p>
    <p >But who cares? I'm going to do this for myself, to improve my skills, learn something, and maybe have some fun with this. I plan on seeing this start to end, which is why I'm keeping this log, to keep myself in check.</p>
    <p >Onto the meatier stuff:</p>
    <p >I plan on the game being rather artwork and narrative intensive. It'll be a first person exploration/thriller type of game, If I can pull that sort of thing off. I really enjoyed the playstyle of Firwatch, a recent great title released by Campo Santo. The style of Firewatch is very linear, almost as if you're in a movie and you can interactact with your environment, but for the most part you are just experiencing the story (the narrative and the beautiful artwork) and have little to no effect on the plot of the story, kind of like a movie. I also enjoyed the way their narrative explored the human psyche, and really drew you into the character's mind. Obviously, as a solo developer, I don't intend on the game being anywhere as beautiful or thought out, however I would really like to adapt the playstyle of the game to something I would enjoy playing.</p>
    <p >This game will not be linear. It will feature several choices you can make that will influence the final ending of the game, however your environment will also force you to make some decisions whether you like them or not. The story is mostly solidified, however I'm still looking into several ways to make it more captivating during the playthrough. I plan on the artwork to be minimalistic, based on low poly meshes, and relying heavily on the colors and shadows to set the mood inside the game. </p>
    <p >I'm using Blender game engine to make this game. Why? you may ask. There are several reasons, actually. I have played around with it in the past, and am rather familiar with how it works and how to work with it. I'm not really interested in releasing this game for a profit, if I do ever get around to releasing it. But mostly, it's because I haven't really ever seen any decent games made with Blender game engine. Maybe this is for good reason. Maybe most devs realise the shortcomings or other obstacles that stop them from using this engine, but this is something I plan on finding out myself. Also, I just really enjoy Python. Thus far, I have I have a portion of the game mechanics done. I'll be working on finalizing them over the coming days. I also have the story virtually done, but again, am looking at making it more extensive. The artwork is in its infantile stage. I have some of the concepts in my head, but am yet to put them on paper or screen. </p>
    <p >Over the coming days, I plan on releasing the premise for the game, updates on the game mechanics, some concept art, and whatever else I deem important or noteworthy enough. Over the coming weeks and months, more artwork will be released, along with more in depth discussions of development progress and conundrums. </p>
    <p >Like I said, this is mainly being done for myself to learn from, but in an effort to speed things along and make the game more visually appealing, I hope to solicit assistance of the artwork and modeling variety from someone or someones else in the future. </p>
