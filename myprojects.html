        <p >In an effort to increase my knowledge in game development, artwork and design, and overall development skill, I've embarked on creating a 3D exploration/thriller game. In order to keep myself in check, I'm keeping a dev log, which you can find in the menu.</p>

    <p > This is a project created during the Fall HackRU 2015. It allows listeners to text music suggestions (title, artist, album) to a DJ, who can then automatically add the suggestions onto their current playlist. Song selections are currently limited to the Spotify library. It ended up winning 3rd place overall and best use of Twilio's API. Richard Murby covered it a bit in <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed-TrJE5_M8?t=6m16s" class="underline" >this Devpost Commit commit video</a>. We're currently slowly working on polishing the app up and releasing it. </p>

    <p >This interactive map categorizes news articles (currently from NYT) into conflict, economic, and environment related news. It then plots them on the map, based on the amount, and where, the articles were written. Consider this a way to gauge interest in conflict, the economy, and the environment, worldwide. I plan on updating this to periodically update articles, and more accurately reflect the amount of article amounts.</p>
