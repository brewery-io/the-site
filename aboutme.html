<p >I'm a goal oriented person; this helps me break down the frequent logical and analytical problems that occur when programming. This is really just a complicated way to say I'm good at problem solving.
    <br />
    <br />
    I am currently enrolled in the Honors Program at Rutgers University where I study computer science and finance.
    <br />
    <br />
    For the past few years, I have applied my skills in web development as a freelance developer as well as an intern developer at Commvault.
    <br />
    <br />
    I often take on side projects, as I enjoy the challenge of solving puzzles and making my ideas come to life. I'm currently working on a 3D exploration/thriller game; check out the dev log!

    <br />
    I enjoy landscape photography, billiards, debating existantialism, and browsing a multitude of subreddits.
